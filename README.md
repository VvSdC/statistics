# Introduction to statistics
Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing and analyzing data. <br><br>

Data => Facts or pieces of information that can be measured,collected and analyzed.    
Examples of data : 
- Weights of students in the class. {60kg,45kg,30kg,...}
- IQ of students in the class {100,110,95,...}

<br>

Importance of statistics : 
- Data Exploration and Summarization
- Model Building and validations
- Statistical analysis
- Hypothesis testing
- Optimization and efficiency
<br>

# Descriptive statistics
<br>
Descriptive statistics involves methods for summarizing and organizing data to make it understandable. This type of statistics helps to describe basic features of the data in a study.
<br><br>

Topics in descriptive statistics:
- Measure of central tendency
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode
- Measure of dispersion
  - Variance
  - Standard deviation
  - Range
- Data distribution
  - Histograms
  - Box plot
  - Pie chart
  - PDF (Probability Density Function)
  - PMF (Probability Masss Function)
- Summary statistics
  - Five Number summary (Minimum value,Q1,Median value,Q3,Maximum value)

<br>

Examples of descriptive statistics:
- Mean score of students
- Range of temperatures
- Histogram of ages

# Inferential statistics
<br>
Inferential statistics involves methods for making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample data. It allows for hypothesis testing, estimation and drawing conclusions.
<br><br>

Topics in inferential statistics:
- Hypothesis testing
   - Null hypothesis
   - Alternative hypothesis
   - P-value
- Confidence intervals
- Regression Analysis
   - Simple regression
   - Multiple linear regression
- Statistical analysis tests
   - Z test
   - T test
   - Annova test
   - CHI square test
<br>

Examples of inferential statistics:
- P-value in test scores comparison.
- 95% confidence interval for average height.
- House price prediction
- Comparing test scores of different schools
- Association between gender and product performance.
