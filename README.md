# Introduction to statistics
Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing and analyzing data. <br><br>

Data => Facts or pieces of information that can be measured,collected and analyzed.    
Examples of data : 
- Weights of students in the class. {60kg,45kg,30kg,...}
- IQ of students in the class {100,110,95,...}

<br>

Importance of statistics :

# Descriptive statistics
<br>
Descriptive statistics involves methods for summarizing and organizing data to make it understandable. This type of statistics helps to describe basic features of the data in a study.
<br><br>

Topics in descriptive statistics:
- Measure of central tendency
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode
- Measure of dispersion
  - Variance
  - Standard deviation
  - Range
- Data distribution
  - Histograms
  - Box plot
  - Pie chart
  - PDF (Probability Density Function)
  - PMF (Probability Masss Function)

<br><br>

Topics in inferential statistics:
- Hypothesis testing
   - Null hypothesis
   - Alternative hypothesis
   - P-value
- Confidence intervals
- Regression Analysis
   - Simple regression
   - Multiple linear regression
- Statistical analysis tests

# Population data

A population is the entire set of individuals or objects of intrest in a particular study. It includes all members of a defined group that we are studying or collecting information on. <br>

<h5>Characteristics of population : </h5>

- Contains all observations of interest. (Complete set)
- Parameter is the numerical value that summarizes entire population i.e population mean,population variance etc.

<br><br>

---

# Sample data

A sample is a subset of the population that is used to represent the entire group. Sampling involves selecting a group of individuals or observations from the population to draw conclusions about the whole population.

<h5>Characteristics of sample data : </h5>

- Subset of population (Represents portion of the population)
- Statistic in the numerical value summarizing the sample data i.e sample mean, sample variance.
- Sample are randomly sampled/selected from the population to avoid bias.

<br><br>

# Statistic vs Parameter

- Statistic is the numerical value that summarizes the <strong>sample data</strong>. Examples of statistic are sample mean,sample variance etc.
- Parameter is the numberical value that summarizes the <strong>population data</strong>. Examples of parameter are population mean, population variance etc.

# Types of Sampling

There are two types of sampling:
- Probability Sampling
- Non probability sampling

<br><br>

---
# Probability sampling

- Simple random sampling : <br><br>
  Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.<br>
  Examples of simple random sampling: <br>
  - Selecting people randomly from the population
  - Drawing names randomly from a class of students
<br>

- Systematic sampling : <br><br>
  Select every nth member of the population after a radmon starting point.<br>
  Examples of systematic sampling : <br>
  - Taking feedback survey from every 7th customer.
<br>

- Stratified sampling: <br><br>
  Divide the population into strata/groups based on specific characteristics and them randomly 
  sample from each strata.<br>
  Examples of stratified sampling : <br>
  - Divide employees in company by department and then randomly select a proportional number 
    from each department to form a survey sample.
  - Dividing people based on age groups
<br>

- Cluster sampling : <br><br>
  We divide the population into clusters, randomly select clusters and then select all members 
  from that clusters. 
  <br>
  Examples of cluster sampling: <br>
  - Randomly select a district and survey all teachers in the selected schools.
<br>

- Multi stage sampling : <br><br>
  We combine different sampling methods. It usually involves selecting clusters and then 
  random sampling within those clusters.<br>
  Examples of multi stage sampling: <br>
  - Randomly select cities and in each selected city, randomly sampling households.

<br><br>

# Non probability sampling

- Convinience sampling: <br><br>
  We select individuals who are easiest to reach.<br>
  Example of covinience sampling:
  - Surveying people at the mall
<br>

- Judgemental/Purposive sampling: <br><br>
  Selecting individuals based on researchers judgement i.e selecting individuals that can be 
  useful or representative.<br>
  Example of judgemental sampling:
  - Choosing experts in a field to participate. (If we want a survey on AI , we would select 
    people are are experts in AI because they are useful.)
<br>

- Snowball sampling: <br><br>
  Existing study subjects recruit future subjects from among their acquaintances.<br>
  Example of snowball sampling:
  - Surveying people having a rare disease.
<br>

- Quota sampling : <br><br>
  Selecting individuals based on characteristics or quota like age, group, gender, religion.
<br>

<h6>Selecting sampling techniques depends on the use case</h6>
<br><br>

# Types of data

There are two types of data :
- [Quantitative data](#quantitative-data)
- [Qualitative data](#qualitative-data)

#### Quantitative data

- Discrete data : <br>
  Discrete data means that data are in the form of whole numbers.<br>
  Example : Number of bank accounts {0,1,2..}, Number of children {0,1,2,3...}
  <br>

- Continuous data : <br>
  Continuous data can have any numerical value.<br>
  Example : Weight {70.11,70.112,70.2...} , Height {6.51,6.553,...}, Speed
  <br><br>
  
#### Qualitative data 
  It is also known as categorical data
  
- Nominal data : <br>
  We donot have any ranking in nominal data. <br>
  Example of nominal data :
  - Gender (M,F), we cannot rank F>M or M>F
  - Blood group (A,B,O..), we cannot rank A > B or B > A
  <br>
- Ordinal data : <br>
  We have ranking in ordinal data. <br>
  Examples of ordinal data: 
  - Customer rating (Good,Bad,worst), we can rank Good>Bad>Worst

## Scales of Measurement of data

The scales of measurement of data describe the nature of information within the values assigned to variables.

There are 4 primary scales of measurement of data:
- [Nominal Scale](#nominal-scale)
- [Ordinal Scale](#ordinal-scale)
- [Interval Scale](#interval-scale)
- [Ratio Scale](#ratio-scale)

## Nominal scale

This scale classifies data into distinct categories that donot have an intrinsic order.
It has Qualtitative/categorical data. <br>

Characteristics of nominal scale : <br>
- Data is categorised based on labels,names or qualities
- Categories are mutually exclusive (Example : Gender can have a value as Male or Female but not both)
- No logical order is present among the categories i.e there is no rank or ordering.

Examples of nominal scale:
- Gender (Male / Female)
- Colors (Violet / Blue/ Green etc)
- Cuisines (Chinese / Italian / Indian etc)


## Ordinal scale

This scale classifies the data into categories that can be ranked or ordered. <br>

Characteristics of ordinal scale:
- Data is categorised and ranked in a specific order.
- The intervals between ranks are not necessarily equal.

Examples of ordinal scale:
- Education level (High School,Bachelors,Masters). They can be ranked as Masters > Bachelors > 
  High School. They can also be ranked as High School = 1, Bachelors = 2 and Masters = 3 after 
  performing feature engineering.
- Customer feedback (Satisfied, Very satisfied,not satisfied). They can be ranked as Very 
  satisfied > satisfied > not statisfied.

## Interval Scale

This scale categorises and orders data like ordinal data but also specifies the exact difference between intervals. **It lacks a true zero point**. <br>

Characteristics of interval scale:
- Data is ordered with consistent interval between values.
- It allows for meaningful comparison of differences but ratio cannot be measured.
- It has no true zero point.

Example of interval scale:
- Temperature in Fahrenheit (10def F,20deg F,30deg F). <br>
  The differences between interval values are equal. <br>
  There is no true zero point i.e odeg F means no temperature.
- IQ score of students (90,100,110)<br>
  The differences between intervals are equal. <br>
  There is no true zero point i.e 0 IQ means no IQ
- Calendar years (2012,2013,2014...) <br>
  The differences between intervals are equal and there is no true zero point.

## Ratio scale

This scale categorises and orders data, differences are measurable and also contain a zero starting point. <br>

Characteristics of ratio scale:
- Data is ordered
- Differences are measurable
- Contains a true zero point i.e has a 0 start point <br>

Example of ratio scale :
- Student marks in exam (0,15,30,45,60...). <br>
  We can say that the person who scored 60 has scored 4 times more than the person who scored 
  15. Differences are equal and there exists a zero starting point too.
