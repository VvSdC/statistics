# Introduction to statistics
Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing and analyzing data. <br><br>

Data => Facts or pieces of information that can be measured,collected and analyzed.    
Examples of data : 
- Weights of students in the class. {60kg,45kg,30kg,...}
- IQ of students in the class {100,110,95,...}

<br>

Importance of statistics : 
- Data Exploration and Summarization
- Model Building and validations
- Statistical analysis
- Hypothesis testing
- Optimization and efficiency
<br>

# Descriptive statistics
<br>
Descriptive statistics involves methods for summarizing and organizing data to make it understandable. This type of statistics helps to describe basic features of the data in a study.
<br><br>

Topics in descriptive statistics:
- Measure of central tendency
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode
- Measure of dispersion
  - Variance
  - Standard deviation
  - Range
- Data distribution
  - Histograms
  - Box plot
  - Pie chart
  - PDF (Probability Density Function)
  - PMF (Probability Masss Function)
- Summary statistics
  - Five Number summary (Minimum value,Q1,Median value,Q3,Maximum value)

<br>

Examples of descriptive statistics:
- Mean score of students
- Range of temperatures
- Histogram of ages

# Inferential statistics
<br>
Inferential statistics involves methods for making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample data. It allows for hypothesis testing, estimation and drawing conclusions.
<br><br>

Topics in inferential statistics:
- Hypothesis testing
   - Null hypothesis
   - Alternative hypothesis
   - P-value
- Confidence intervals
- Regression Analysis
   - Simple regression
   - Multiple linear regression
- Statistical analysis tests
   - Z test
   - T test
   - Annova test
   - CHI square test
<br>

Examples of inferential statistics:
- P-value in test scores comparison.
- 95% confidence interval for average height.
- House price prediction
- Comparing test scores of different schools
- Association between gender and product performance.

# Population data

A population is the entire set of individuals or objects of intrest in a particular study. It includes all members of a defined group that we are studying or collecting information on. <br>

<h5>Characteristics of population : </h5>

- Contains all observations of interest. (Complete set)
- Parameter is the numerical value that summarizes entire population i.e population mean,population variance etc.

<br><br>

---

# Sample data

A sample is a subset of the population that is used to represent the entire group. Sampling involves selecting a group of individuals or observations from the population to draw conclusions about the whole population.

<h5>Characteristics of sample data : </h5>

- Subset of population (Represents portion of the population)
- Statistic in the numerical value summarizing the sample data i.e sample mean, sample variance.
- Sample are randomly sampled/selected from the population to avoid bias.

# Statistic vs Parameter

- Statistic is the numerical value that summarizes the <strong>sample data</strong>. Examples of statistic are sample mean,sample variance etc.
- Parameter is the numberical value that summarizes the <strong>population data</strong>. Examples of parameter are population mean, population variance etc.

# Types of Sampling

There are two types of sampling:
- Probability Sampling
- Non probability sampling

<br><br>

---
# Probability sampling

- Simple random sampling : <br><br>
  Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.<br><br>
  Examples of simple random sampling: <br>
  - Selecting people randomly from the population
  - Drawing names randomly from a class of students

- Systematic sampling : <br><br>
  Select every nth member of the population after a radmon starting point.<br><br>
  Examples of systematic sampling : <br>
  - Taking feedback survey from every 7th customer.

- Stratified sampling: <br><br>
  Divide the population into strata/groups based on specific characteristics and them randomly 
  sample from each strata.<br><br>
  Examples of stratified sampling : <br>
  - Divide employees in company by department and then randomly select a proportional number 
    from each department to form a survey sample.
  - Dividing people based on age groups

- Cluster sampling : <br><br>
  We divide the population into clusters and then randomly select members from each cluster. 
  <br>
  Examples of cluster sampling: <br>
  - Randomly select several schools from a district and randomly surveying all teachers within 
    those schools.
