# Measure of central tendency

Measures of central tendency are statistical metrics that describe the center point or typical value of a dataset. They provide a single value that summarizes a set of data by identifying central position within that dataset.

Different measures of dataset:
- [Mean](#mean)
- [Median](#median)
- [Mode](#mode)

### Mean

Mean is the sum of all values divided by number of values.<br>

Characteristics of mean:
- [Mean is affected by extreme outliers](#affect-of-extreme-outliers-on-mean)
- Mean is used for interval and ratio data.

<br>
We can observe that adding just one outlier changed the mean from 3 to 22. So, we can say that mean can be affected by outliers. But **just because it is simply an outlier, we cannot remove it directly because every data point plays an important role**.

### Median

Median is the middle value in a dataset where values in the dataset are arranged in ascending or descending order.<br><br>

**If size of the data is odd** , Median is just the middle element of the dataset after arranging the data in ascending or descending order.

<br><br>
**If size of the data is even**, Median is the average of two middle elements of the dataset after arranging the data in ascending or descending order.
